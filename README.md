# WebscraperRepo

* __Please open the .ipynb in JupyterLab before navigating using the internal links, they will not work in GitHub__
* Repository housing a Jupyter Notebook which leverages the PRAW Python package in order to scrape [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) data
# Why Reddit

* "Reddit is a social news platform that allows users to discuss and vote on content that other users have submitted. there are small communities called subReddits that bring people and their interests together."
* In this particular Jupyter Notebook I am scraping title data from the subReddit [r/CryptoMoonShots](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/) in order to try and determine the most frequently mentioned cryptocurrency in the first 350 "hot" posts
